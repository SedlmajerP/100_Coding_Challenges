# Question 22
# Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input.
# The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.


# sentence = input().split()
# lst = []
# for w in sentence:
#     x = (f"{w}:{sentence.count(w)}")
#     lst.append(x)
# sorted = sorted(lst)
# for e in sorted:
#     print(e)


# Question 23
# Write a method which can calculate square value of number

# class MyClass:
#     def squared(self, num):
#         print(num**2)


# my_math = MyClass()
# my_math.squared(7)

# Question 24
# Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it,
# you can read document online or find some books.
# But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
# Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
# And add document for your own function
