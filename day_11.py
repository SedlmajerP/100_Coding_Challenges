# Question 38
# With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half
# values in one line and the last half values in one line.

# Write a program to generate and print
# another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

# Write a program which accepts a string as input to
# print "Yes" if the string is "yes" or "YES" or "Yes", otherwise print "No".Ë‡
